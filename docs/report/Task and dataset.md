 We consider the sequential recommendation task. Given the historical interaction sequence of one user {i1, . . . , il}, the task is to predict the next item of interest il+1, where l is the length of the interaction sequence for the user. The items in the interaction sequence have been ordered chronologically. Here, each item i is associated with a sentence that represents the metadata of the corresponding item. Note that in practice, the items in the interaction sequences and the items to predict are usually from the same domain defined in the Amazon Reviews datasets (Kang and McAuley, 2018; Hou et al., 2022).
