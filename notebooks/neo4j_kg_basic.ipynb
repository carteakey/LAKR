It was hard to even look at each other without spite in our eyes, that only kinda look reserved for someone you loathe. And since our daughter is just starting her sophomore year at Watkins as an art major (don't get me started on that old chestnut), and our good for nothing son that just graduated and is living somewhere in Colorado, probably smoking that \"weed\" whilst acting like a jackass, we have nothing to distracts ourselfs from the plain and simple fact that we don't enjoy each other's company.<br />  That is, until we find Mario party. Everytime we play, I forget that I sign half of everything I own away in a prenup I didn't read because I was \"young\" and \"in love\". My wife tells me frequently that her favorite part of the game is when you punch the dice to roll your turn, as to release pent up aggression that she feels when I stumble in late at night wearing the scent of stale tobacco, two full glasses of vodka, and perfume that she doesn't own. All in this game is a hoot and and only is now getting old, which now after my life experience is that I should probably return game and run as fast as I can the other way.

      "Huge fan of this series - yes even Legends I could tolerate.  Regardless, Firefly has forced me to actually get a pen name and create a review for the first time.  I have bought many items from Amazon, and always thought that writing a review (which I usually listen to - or at least use to make a basic opinion) was a good way to pass along information about good products when shopping around.  Having said that 99.9% of all products I have bought have been good or exceptional.  This game sucks badly - in every imaginable way.  The bugs make it unplayable, crashes when you get close to finishing the scenario, units will not respond immediately and food and people production is very frustrating.  I really can't believe they released this as it is.  Yes, they will sell some games and cover their costs - but trust me when I say they have hurt their fan base badly.  I pre-ordered this game.  Never again Firefly - you have proven that customer satisfaction is not a concern with your company.  I imagine others will remember as well.\n",

      "First off, I suggest anyone wanting this game, WAIT!!! It's too freakin' high and you'll be disappointed with a few things, so wait on it. That seems to be the general consensus. The new graphics are great! But it's overpriced and for everyone out there who were expecting to play this game while traveling to someplace without a internet connection, forget it. You have to play it via the internet only. HUGE MISTAKE.<br />  I picked up my copy yesterday like all loyal Blizzard Starcraft fans out there. It was like Christmas for me back when I was a kid. I couldn't wait to get home and rip that sucker open. Then things became abundantly clear for me. All that delays,  all the silence, no reviews, nothing coming out of the Blizzard camp except trailers I've been watching for 2 yrs and the promise of something new, something fantastic, and something that will make the original Starcraft look like Pong. Well, I'm still waiting to be impressed.<br /><br />  I am so angry about this! I can't even articulate accurately what exactly I'm disappointed with the most. The lack of LAN playing is serious let down since it's how I first learned to play SC. The biggest disappointment has to be the lack of stand alone playing. We live in a time where there are gaming laptops out there that are nearly as powerful and fast as desktops. Being able to play this game anywhere is one of the things I was so looking forward to and now, I learn that that's not the case. Truth is, SC was the first game I ever played on a PC when I bought my first back in 98. (besides solitaire anyway) Staying up all night playing, spending entire weekends being a mindless zombie battling the evil swarm. Luckily, I had a treadmill. Anyway, this is bad, but not all bad. Still, it's getting 2 stars just because of the high price and dependency on the internet just to play in single player mode. I feel as if I paid [...] bucks so I could be told what I could do with what I paid for. This isn't like Blizzard and I gotta ask, what was the motivation for them doing this to their loyal fan base of their award winning games. Do they give out golden turkey awards for games ?<br /><br />  One of the impressive things about most of Blizzard products is that I could always play by myself and be happy doing that. I could play anywhere, anytime as long as I had my trusty gaming laptop. What the hell were they thinking! You have to have an internet connection to play? That's ludicrous! No wonder they kept that tidbit quiet and kept all things quiet because there's now way in hell this game is going to win Game of the year. Blizzard betrayed their followers and loyal fans. So, I guess when my internet is down, I'll just have to play pong to keep myself entertained now. Needless to say, I won't be buying SC 3 or any of SC2 expansion packs unless the online crap goes the way of the dodo Thanks Blizzard.<br /><br />  I'm a very patient person and I'm always positive by nature. The reviews of SC2 are pouring in and most of them aren't positive. I feel like I've been robbed though like most. I love the familiar feeling I get from the game, but I guess I just was expecting something groundbreaking, something spectacular, something new. Graphics are good, storyline is great, but the game is a huge let down over all. I guess I'll have to become a Microsoft game fan and hope they'll come up with a good new strategy game. Blizzard, you've lost a fan. Good luck gang.<br /><br />  I'm no stock market analyst, but it's my guess that the money you've made from this game so far will take a sharp decline within the next week after this bad release. This rings of the recent iPhone 4 situation. I really hope someone from Blizzard is actually reading these reviews because and respond quickly about it. I don't think this will happen though. I really don't think they care.\n",

      "I love this game. Normally I don't have time to write reviews, but I just want to help address a few things that other people complain about.<br /><br />Firstly, it is certainly a game that you will either love or hate, rarely anything in between (hence the average rating of 3 stars here -- there are about as many 5 stars as their are 1 star reviews). To this, it is probably a matter of determining if you ever had a childhood fancy to be a pirate. Who doesn't love pirates and adventure on the high seas, and BOOTY?<br /><br />The main complain people have has to be that some people think it is repetitious and shallow. While it can be grindy and repetitious, the game actually changes as you play in that the challenges get, well, more challenging. As you level up in the guilds, you also go to the next tier of missions which ask increasingly more of you to do, and provide greater rewards. So at first you are catching one or two chickens, taking on a single pirate skeleton crew, or finding a single chest, but at level 25 and above, and after you start to understand the game more, it can get pretty exciting. But really where the meat and potatoes are here is from your experience with others.<br /><br />The next complain would have to be that your upgrades are all cosmetic, with the exception of a few (like sniper rifle with better scope). While I am not sure what Rare has planned here in their updates, it is true for the most part, but the goal of the game was to keep everyone on a similar keel for competition purposes, rather than leveling up to become the most OP pirate on the server. Also, the objective of the game is to become a famed pirate (the final achievement), that is your goal.<br /><br />And finally, the other complain would have to be the griefers. I won't deny that there are griefers, but they have mechanics built into the game now (after the first update or so) where you can avoid them if you really want to. One such example is when you die, while you wait in the afterlife to respawn there is a poster on the wall that allows you to answer if you feel like you are being attacked by griefers. If you say yes, you are sent elsewhere (it seems like to another server). Other than that, once you stick with the game and learn the mechanics and system, you can turn the tables on the griefers and get revenge. Personally that is what I do, I don't mess with anyone but if they attack me, then ITS ON and I will make them regret it (revenge is sweet in this game).<br /><br />And that leads to the games biggest strengths...<br /><br />Personally I love the art style, and the sound is SUPERB, and it has the best water you will see in any game I can ever recall.  Also, you can go around talking into your headset like a pirate (just put &#34;arrrgh!!!!&#34; in front of everything you say, and you get to say &#34;booty&#34; in like every other sentence).  But all that is really small potatoes to the game's biggest strength: the story you create at sea from the crazy things that happen and the interactions you have with others (both with friendlies and hostiles). You can certainly play with a crew of friends and that would be fun, but my friends happen to be interested in other games (we rarely find a single game we all play at the same time).  So, I mostly play alone, but I have also played plenty open crew sessions with others on Xbox Live and it has been a blast. If you find it isn't then you only have to leave the game and join to a different crew (that is the key - don't just settle on the first crew you find, find a good one where everyone is communicating and working together and not acting like D bags!).<br /><br />So back to the STORIES you create.<br /><br />What I mean is, the more you play the richer the experience can become to the point that you will actually play into situations that you could never recreate again, ever. You will find yourself saying &#34;I remember the time when...!&#34;.  Some examples of stories I will never forget...<br /><br />-The time when we took a galleon (crew of 4) to a &#34;skull fort&#34; and fought through the waves of skeletons to collect about 10,000 in treasure. Upon leaving, we got into a running battle with two other galleons, only to end up being sunk by the Kraken, and we returned to the area and fought over the treasure that was up for grabs (that was exciting to me).<br /><br />-The time when I alone on a sloop, passing by a skull fort and was hailed by a crew of another sloop (small ship, crew of 2) and we agreed to work together on the skull fort and split the loot (which we did, without a single underhanded incident, agreeing to divide the loot 1/3 each and we went our separate ways).<br /><br />-The time when we saw another galleon sunk by a pirate crew, and we picked up the ship-less crew on our passing galleon and we chased down the pirates with a crew of 8 (rather than the normal 4).  That was a very strange situation where two crews worked together, sailing the same ship.<br /><br />-Another time when I was alone, minding my business and attacked by a sloop (crew of 2) and we went on a wild chase/battle where I eventually got away. I later hunted them down and ambushed them (recognizing their sail and hull colors), leading to another long running battle (about 40 minutes long) where we blasted each other, repaired damages, ran each other into rocks, and still neither ship could get the best of each other. Near the end of the battle, I put a gun powder keg on the bow of the ship and rammed them, it exploded and nearly sank us both. Finally we called a truce (by flashing lanterns) a breaking off. In this case even though they attacked me, we parted with respect and they possibly thought twice about ambushing the next ship.<br /><br />-And finally (because I am tired of typing), the time when, again, minding my own business on a sloop alone (doing merchant missions), I was attacked by a galleon with crew of 4, leading to a running battle. After executing several 180 &#34;anchor turns&#34;, and hitting them with cannon fire, they were eventually led into rocks, crashed, repaired their damage and I got away. I went to a nearby fort and gathered gun power barrels, followed them to an island where they landed to explore and left the ship. I swam over like a ninja with a gun powder barrel, put it inside the ship, and exploded it which sank their ship. Then returned and gathered the floating treasure and got away. This is that &#34;sweet revenge&#34; that is possible, if you are into that competitive play.  If you aren't into that, then you can certainly end up on a server where everyone is friendly (I have seen it many times), or join a galleon crew and drive off any griefers. You can certainly also get away from any pursuit ship too, if you stick with the game long enough to get your sailing skills down.<br /><br />But let's face it, what really gets you on the seat of your pants and gets the excitement pumping is when two ships are going at it, and two crews trying to out think the other.<br /><br />Also, more of closing comment here, I do love the fact that Rare is adding new content to the game for free, with planned updates/upgrades. Yes, you can argue that it should have been there from the start, but I am a game developer myself and the reality is that they have to release the game at some point, and the game has been in development for quite some years.  I look at it this way: I learn the game and get deeper into the community experience, it is nice to know that a little something new is being (and will be) added from time to time to keep it fresh.<br /><br />Give it a try and see if you like it if you are on the fence (as a rental, then buy if you like), but if you love pirates, sailing ships, and are competitive then this is an easy purchase.\n",

      "So, yes the Wii U didn't get the bonus map at launch, and it doesnt have DLC at launch.

No. But those consoles aren't even out yet.<br /><br />These other reviewers are being bitter, but guess what... the Wii U version is just as good, if not better than, the PS3 and Xbox360 version aside from the lack of DLC, which may come later, and which isn't even release yet in general (except the Free Fall bonus map).\n",

      "The working relationship between a game designer and his publisher is never a simple one. So I would not know where exactly to place the blame, Sid Meyer or 2K GAMES. But in the end, it does not matter. Because it is simply sad to see a great gaming franchise came to this.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A CIVILIZATION GAME<br />A great number of major features of this beloved series have been simply removed. A fellow gamer called this \"Civilization For Dummies\" and he is absolutely right.<br />There is no trading maps or technologies. There is no claiming resources outside your borders by building a colony. There is no need for transport ships as units apparently are now all..amphibious (and they need 15-20 turns to cross an ocean!). There are no city-growth milestone requirements (granary, aqueduct, refrigeration). There is no culturally conquering an enemy city (detonating a \"culture bomb\" by consuming a Great Artist will only get you extra territory tiles but no cities). There are no spies nor health/pollution balance. And there are no armies (please read on).<br /><br />ARMY CASTRATION<br />Someone please tell me what was so wrong with armies that had to be yanked out? Napoleon almost conquered Europe with one army. Germany almost conquered the eastern hemisphere with three and the US still holds a two-and-a-half armies doctrine. How can a turn-based game be called Civilization unless one can emulate, well, a real civilization? Building an army, seasoning it on minor conflicts and then going for the enemy's capital was one of the most fun parts of any Civilization game. Why Sid, why?<br /><br />YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LAUNCH INTO SPACE YET CANNOT CLIMB MOUNTAINS?!<br />Movement should be hindered by rough terrain. Units that have 3 or 4 moves on the plains should not be expected to do more than 1 or 2 on a mountain, right? Well, no. Mountains seem to be those magical places no unit can climb or pass through (not even ...helicopters of jet fighters!). And I cannot see how this makes for more complicated strategic decisions than timing your movements, claiming the high ground and having a bonus for elevated artillery?<br /><br />UNIT STAMPEDE<br />A major issue for me, this was what really ruined the game. For some unfathomable reason units cannot be stacked. A worker can coexist with a military unit but that's it. Artillery and shock-cavalry are very vulnerable to attacks and (with the new hexagon layout) one would need ...six defensive units to protect a single artillery battery.<br />As a result, units keep getting on each other's way (especially when ordered to move for distances that require more than a turn), they refuse to even pass through friendly units (!) and the \"tactical\" considerations that result from this are trivial. And whenever besieging an enemy city, one has to endlessly maneuver his units around it (while exposed to its bombardment) whereas wounded units are never easy to withdraw.<br />You cannot even garrison more than a single unit within a city. Not that it would make a difference, since the garrisoned unit is not automatically awaken to fight back when the city is under attack(!), the city is left to defend itself.<br /><br />CAN YOU REALLY COMMAND WITHOUT A...CENTRAL COMMAND?<br />The economy is nose-diving into the red and you want to reduce the percentage going into research for a while to avoid having units of yours deleted one by one? The fickle people of your civilization are unhappy and you want to placate them by increasing their entertainment allocation? You have discovered conscription and you want to upgrade all your musketeers into recruits? Well, TOUGH LUCK! There is not central command screen to do so. Only advisers that you have to thank for annoying you.<br />You have zero control of both your cities resource distribution and your national economy. And units have to be hunted down and upgraded one by one.<br />Speaking of the economy, when are going to see a Civilization game where one can run and manage a national debt?<br /><br />NO FREE EYE-CANDY IN THIS UNIVERSE. NOT EVEN A STALE ONE.<br />The game does look new and polished and the units are well designed but not cutting edge and not without a steep hardware price. If you expect anything comparable to STARCRAFT II crispiness you will be disappointed - at my 1280x1024 resolution it is not easy to discern roads from railroads.<br />The system I am running my copy was top of the line about a year ago and still I had to tweak the video settings with a mix of high and medium to get it running. Even then, whenever I scroll to a different location of the map, I can see the image fleshing out, just like zooming in a Google-Earth map.<br />So one can only wonder: why should one need a...Cray to run a Civilization game at full?<br /><br />STEAM OF WAR<br />The game requires OnLine Activation (and rumored perpetual reactivation every few days) and has to be tied to a STEAM account. Effectively this means that the game is a piece of rentware the buyer never really owns and yet it is sold at full price. I realize that to some people this may not be a serious issue so, in case you are wondering, I deducted a single star from my overall rating of the game because of its DRM scheme. To every other gamer however, you can now make an informed decision.<br /><br />This was a major disappointment. I never though I'd say this but I while playing the latest Civilization game I caught myself wondering if they would ever make...CALL TO POWER III.<br /><br />New gamers, steer clear of this mess, this is NOT what a Civilization game plays like.<br />Seasoned gamers, we know better than to call this a Civilization game.<br /><br />Sorry Sid, EPIC FAIL.\n",

      "To start I have owned every Call of Duty and have been quite a loyal player. BUT<br />This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst put together game I have every seen published by Activision.<br /><br />I have played this game on both the 360 and the Xbox One. Its like Infinity Ward went about making this game for every console under the sun and didn't pay attention to what made their multiplayer tick. Which was a simplistic yet customizable multiplayer.<br /><br />People buy COD for the multiplayer, and for me this one was the largest let down of any game in the series thus far... they would have been better off just making this a single generation game instead of making it for FOUR consoles and PC... that's just too much to ask for from any studio...<br /><br /> Ghosts multiplayer is just... broken... that is the only way to put it... the guard dog kill streaks will LITERALLY jump over buildings and bite you in the throat, C4 IEDs are timed so short if you set one off their is no chance of survival. Map design for this COD just doesn't seem to jive with me either, their are points in pretty much every game where it seems that everyone has just lit up the camp fires and busted out the smores... the maps are too large for the current low player cap. If the count was doubled these maps would be great fast paced shoot em ups like COD used to be.\n",

      "Opinions on this game have certainly proven to be as divisive as the initial reaction to the original Mafia in 2002, right down to the 4/10 Eurogamer review. It's understandable because while Mafia 2 does far more right than it does wrong, the wrongs are difficult to ignore.<br /><br />Mafia 2 is a linear story-driven game set in the 1940s-1950s with an open world city as a backdrop for immersion purposes. This game is not a GTA4 clone and has never advertised itself to be one, any expectations for it to be so are entirely the fault of uninformed gamers. The city is about 10 square miles in size and highly detailed, it's a beautiful recreation of the time period and the devs use it effectively during certain story segments to give the impression of a city evolving with time. There are gas stations, clothing stores, diners, gun shops, body shops and a scrap yard/docking area to interact with throughout the game, along with different living residences depending on where you are during the storyline and locations that only open for missions. You will not find GTA-like mini games like throwing darts or anything like that, but that doesn't mean the open city is devoid of things to do. You can steal cars in multiple ways (breaking the window, picking the lock, or even shooting the lock) then take them to a body shop to change the plates and paint color to legalize it, then customize it further through engine upgrades for better handling and changing the tires for looks. You can pick fights with the various gangs that have established holds on various parts of the city, rob stores, or anger the police to see how long you can hold out. Just like the original Mafia, the city is all about creating immersion and giving opportunity for the player to create their own experiences rather than fill it with mini-games.<br /><br />Mafia 2's story runs anywhere from 8-15 hours of game time, depending on difficulty level and how quickly you move through it. You play as Vito and are often accompanied by his childhood friend Joe, and spend most of the game in some state of proving yourself to one of the Mafia families in Empire Bay. My initial impression of the story wasn't a good one, but after playing it again it finally hit me what the story was about and my opinion changed drastically. Unlike Mafia 1, this is not a rags to riches story and this is not about the fall of an honorable man. Vito is not Tommy and he's not meant to be. Vito is a guy that is entirely driven by not becoming a loser dockworker like his father: he wants money, cars, women, the nice house, and the nice clothes. To him everything hinges on possessions and thus everything and everyone becomes possessions to him. It's the story of a destructive, selfish man who goes out and takes what he wants and how that devastates everyone around him. I really, really enjoyed the story, including the ending I originally found abrupt, once I realized that.<br /><br />There has been some criticism leveled at Mafia 2 for racism and sexism, but most of it is not being looked at properly. Yes, the main characters are racist and sexist and there isn't anybody there to tell them off for it...because this takes place in the '40s and early '50s, from largely uneducated, ignorant, poor characters involved with the Mafia. Their attitudes were normal for the time period, social circles, and social stature. And as already said, Vito views women the same way he views cars and money; they are things to be obtained, not people to establish relationships with.<br /><br />Yes, there are vintage Playboy covers/centerfolds as optional collectibles in-game and feature the nudity you'd expect from them. These have earned quite a bit of ire and are used as support for the game being sexist, but I -- as a female gamer -- don't agree with it. For one, they are completely optional and very easy to miss even if you're looking for them. They don't float above the ground and spin and glow and have a \"CLICK ME!\" sign above them like collectibles in other games. Instead, they're stashed on desks or half-under beds and other places you'd expect someone to leave them. They blend in perfectly with the environment and look only slightly different from other decorations...they're practically pixel hunts. They don't offer any kind of tangible reward outside of an achievement and completion percentage that would force you to collect them if you didn't want to. They also tie in perfectly with Vito's attitude...he's *exactly* the type of guy that'd grab some poor late night security guard's dirty magazine while robbing the place, and reflects his view of everything being possessions. It's just like the other collectible, the Wanted Posters. Vito would be just as inclined to yank down Wanted Posters as he would steal Playboy mags, there's nothing random or out of place about them. If they were required to unlock guns or cars or something from a gameplay point of view, I'd understand the furor over them, but as is I have no problem with their implementation.<br /><br />For better or worse the difficulty is nowhere near the original's occasionally punishing level, and veterans of the first will want to skip right to the Hard level to avoid falling asleep. I honestly can't imagine who they tuned the Easy/Normal difficulties for, as I am nowhere near an amazing third person shooter player but even I blazed through Normal as if nothing was even shooting back before turning it up. On Hard if you don't make use of the cover system you'll end up very dead very fast, usually within three shots from a typical pistol. The cover system is standard fare nowadays, if you've played Mass Effect 2 or Gears of War you'll be right at home. The shooting missions all take place in unique areas of the city that you normally don't have access to and the set pieces are great, but just like Mafia 1 you will spend a significant amount of time driving to and from locations, doing escort missions, drop off missions, and so on.<br /><br />The amount of time spent in the car is both a blessing and a curse, as the city and music is all a fantastic experience, but it also means you get a lot of opportunities to see the quirky AI at work and some people are going to be annoyed at having to obey the speed limit or risk the police. Yes, while they've removed the requirement to stop at red lights, police will still come after you if they catch you speeding. They've added a kind of cruise control to keep your speed under control this time around if needed though. Some of the AI for the other motorists can be very strange. I had one civilian car randomly decide to slam into me on a bridge and send me plummeting to my demise, while another didn't acknowledge my existence and slammed into me and caused the police to chase me for a hit and run. On the other hand, there have been some pretty fantastic moments just watching the AI interact. One occurred while I was stopped at a red light (habit), and one car rear ended another. The victim jumped out of his car to drag the offending driver out to start pummeling him...not noticing the police car that witnessed the entire thing, who also jumped out to break up the fight and issue fines/arrests. Yes, the AI has flaws, but it's worth putting up with it's quirks to have completely unscripted moments like this occur.<br /><br />So that's been a lot of praise, what went wrong?<br /><br />It's mostly down to what seems to be cut or just plain held back content. The story is pretty short and there is no option for an after-the-story free roam, so you have to load up previous chapters and ignore current mission objectives to do so, which causes problems with the saving mechanics (more on that soon). Not having a free roam available is pretty hard to forgive, as this was in the original and worked great.<br /><br />There is also a complete lack of side quests in Empire Bay...but the introductions and NPCs for them are suspiciously still present, and even tell you to come back later for more jobs that don't actually exist. These side missions were either outright cut due to time or held back to release as DLC packs. There are at least four NPCs that are prime candidates for future DLC that the game desperately needed to begin with, and it doesn't stop there. There are shockingly few available cars to steal and clothes to buy in game, so that makes it hard to see all of the pre-order exclusives held back. It's even to the point that one of the car models (the Hot-Rod in the Greaser pack) appears once in-game, and there is no possible way for you to store that car in your garage...even if you go to pains to get both the mission related car and it's variant out into the open world by using one car to push the other out of the mission zone. It's perfectly drivable, upgradeable, and everything else, but if you don't have the pre-order pack, too bad. Which is a real shame and feels like a really cheap move by 2K.<br /><br />They also cut public transportation and melee weapons, along with all sorts of little touches (sitting down on benches or chairs, newspapers, all kinds of interactive stuff). The melee weapons are especially missed, as the fist-fights often feel very anemic and simple without them.<br /><br />The save/check point system is also problematic. It's pretty much the mirror image of Mafia 1, but this is something that was a negative back then, too. They didn't need to implement quick saves, but a more thorough auto-save feature would have been a huge bonus. As it is, one of the AI drivers randomly sending you off a bridge can result in a lot of lost progress. In addition to the auto saves being sparse, which can make trying to do a free roam game difficult all by itself, reloading a previous chapter wipes your current progress. There are no save slots, so you either continue from your last auto-save, load up a previously played chapter (thus replacing the auto save), or start a new game (also replacing the auto save). This, quite frankly, sucks. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a free-roam mode unlocked after finishing the story, but add that to the skimpy amount of auto save points and no free roam mode and it's a major oversight.<br /><br />I also really dislike the health regen mechanic. I realize that this was mostly a change made to try and appeal to the Halo-generation, but in a lot of ways it makes the diners almost useless. Between the regen, the free food at your home, and the auto-healing between chapters, it's very rare that you need to use the diners or food stands unless you're doing some free roam mischief. And (yes, I am harping about it) since there is no free roam mode, this is pretty glaring.<br /><br />As a side note, Mafia 2 does use Steamworks as it's DRM, so there is no getting around attaching it to the Steam client even if you buy retail and negates whatever used market that still exists for PC games. Steamworks enables some very comprehensive stat tracking (including an amusing stat for time spent looking at Playboys), a smooth DLC store experience (even though you'll likely end up angry at what ends up there), and achievements for the OCD to collect. I do realize that it'll be a dealbreaker for some even if it doesn't bother me at all, but that is something everybody needs to decide for themselves. If you're unsure or have never used Steam before, you can try the demo and see how it works...just make sure to delete your progress on the demo before starting a new game on the full version, as there's a progress-related bug with the save data.<br /><br />Despite some (pretty major) complaints, I still enjoyed the heck out of this game and recommend it if you enjoyed the first or are just a fan of single player story-based games. I'd actually put the star rating at a 3.5 if possible, but rounded up due to genuinely enjoying the story and game despite the flaws.\n",

      "Here is the deal. I want to play as a caveman or cavewoman respectively. I have probably wanted such a game for twenty years. Lets face it market diversity isn't something common among triple AAA games and so this is a treat. But I also don't want to play a pooping your pants simulator. Or a hydration, berry picking, and shelter simulator to stay alive.<br />Stuff like that is annoying as hell to me. I just want to play a game with some reasonable depth but I also don't want it to go overboard. Now some might insult me and claim that I am just stupid and simple minded. That a game with intense survival systems, such as cold, hunger, thrist and pooping your pants is for intelligent people.<br />Well I do that in real life and I guess that makes me a genius! Also most of those things aren't fun to do. I mean I think we all enjoy taking a poop while looking at a Kanye poster to help things move along but generally dropping our brown friends isn't fun.<br />For people who don't know? There is already a game with cavemen called Arc. A survival game with shelter building and pooping. It's a early access game a very well done but not for me. It has elements that I described.<br />This game is fantastic, it has just enough depth to be interesting and just enough things added to be fun as hell. Like training pets and even using them as mounts. That is insanely cool. You can also use an Owl as a spirit guide and check on enemies in the distance.<br />The open world makes it even better for sure. There are elements that hint at survival without going overboard as well. I also love the fact this feels like history in some ways, without having a PBS extreme feel. It's a caveman fantasy and by damned it's perfect for me.<br />There is a major problem with this game. And it's a problem the series always had. If you have played one Far Cry game, especially the recent ones. It can feel exhausting because they can get redundant - for a new game that is okay. But by game five it can feel more of the same despite the change of setting and fun combat in this one. This game is damn near perfect for me. But the reality is if it wasn't a primal setting? I would not like it as much because it would be just another Far Cry game to me.<br /> So if you go into this game wanting to be a caveman - buy it now, hard to imagine most would be disappointed. But if you go into this game thinking of it as a Far Cry only game and don't care about the setting? You could be disappointed due to the reasons I like it - it's a far drifted theme of the series. But I personally love it.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Animal companion training<br />- Animal Mounts<br />- Animal attacks<br />- Spirit owl who works as a scout and attacker<br />- Primal setting, think of Quest for Fire meets 10,000 BC (only the good stuff)<br />- Graphics<br />- Art direction<br />- Open World<br />- Music and sound<br />- Character design<br />- Combat<br /><br />Cons<br />- repetitive  game elements<br />- Lack of investment in a good story<br />- Weak characters and villians<br />- did not come with real life prehistoric pets! ; -)<br /><br />Grade<br />A\n",

      "This game is a lot of fun, my favorite out of the 5 games I have purchased at launch.  Soccer is hilarious, basically you pass the ball down the field (choosing from a left pass, right pass or straight pass), while your opponent attempts to block the pass.  Once you get past defenders and are 1v1 with the goalie you can shoot, and your opponent can try to save.  It sounds simple enough but the camera is very responsive and the game gets frenetic and fun while playing.  There are also opportunities for throw ins, corner kicks and headers etc, but the nuts and bolts is the simple pass and shoot.<br /><br />Next there is bowling, which is a lot of fun and again the camera is very responsive.<br /><br />Track and field has 5 events.  Sprint, pretty basic....run in place.  Next is Javelin Throw, also fun.  Then there is the long jump, which is cool.  Following that is discus, actually very lame, could not consistantly get good flights from discus.  Lastly is hurdles, not really all that fun, but ok.<br /><br />Next up is Boxing.  Boxing is ok, but by far the most effective tactic is throw wildly rather than take a methodical approach...that actually kind of ruins it for me, I wanted something a little more strategy and skill based.<br /><br />Beach Volleyball is a lot of fun, but it really seems the most forgiving with its camera response.  I feel like a lot of times if you are just in the general viscinity it will count as a bump.  Scoring can take a lot of volleys but I guess that is ok.<br /><br />Last is Table Tennis.  Response is pretty good not much variation in shots and putting spin seems rather difficult.<br /><br />There are also minigames for many of the sports listed, helps keep the replay up.  The comparisons to the Wii SPorts are inevitable and in all honesty, besides the superior graphics of the xbox, the comparison is merited.  The thing that really gives this title the one up may or may not have anything to do with the game itself.  The Kinect camera I think is what sets this game apart.  You can play in darkness in the middle of the living room, you can play with people of all sizes (I have two kids that played and it calibrated them seamlessly), the camera really responds!  The funny replays at the end of each event is awesome too, you really look completely foolish playing these games and the playback is a helpful reminder not to take these games too serious!  This title is worth the $50, some of the other games you can just rent (fighters uncaged, sonic riders etc).

      "For many of you who enjoy the Megaten series, you may already be well aware of this series. Two years ago, Persona 3 broke onto the PS2, creating an influx of newcomers and old school gamers alike. It provided a unique battle system, an intriguing dark story, a plethora amount of characters, and overall a great experience. Persona 4 is a standalone game, bringing many of the features, settings, and atmosphere from P3.<br /><br />You are a silent protagonist who transfers into a rural area. Soon enough, you find something mysterious and dangerous. On one rainy night, you look into a television. Voices begin to ring, the storm seems to enrage, and the television flickers on and off. Reaching into the t.v, you are sucked into a whole new dimension.<br /><br />Interesting, is it not? You'll find many mysteries held within the storyline. Unlike the city life in P3, you're in a very small town named Inaba.<br /><br />The battle system holds its true colors. Although this time around, there are some tweaks. In P3, you were unable to control your allies, as they were under the influence of the AI. All you could really do was give them certain commands. This time around though, you are able to control their every move. These actions include using items, attacking, and defending. The all-out-attack is still implemented and the battle mechanics overall are ALL the same.<br /><br />For those who have played P3, Tartartus was a large dungeon with many different themes and atmospheres. Instead of that, the dungeons in this game are spread out. Giving a more variety in gameplay. Each dungeon is uniquely themed based on the storyline. One night, you may be going through a steamy spa, the next you may going through an abandoned mall.<br /><br />Many of the things you find in P3 and, to an extent P2, are all found in Persona 4. If you love the Persona series or you are a newcomer, pick this up, it's well worth your money.<br /><br />(Side Note: For those who pre-ordered this game, the art-book is quite large (100 pages) and provides a few major spoilers. It's highly recommended you wait to look at it later. Although, the presentation of the package is wonderful, giving both the artbook and soundtrack is awesome).<br /><br />Pros<br />+Fast-paced action.<br />+A great, long story. Develops quite fast.<br />+Interesting concept. Different from many other RPGs.<br />+Amazing soundtrack and character voices. It won't disappoint.<br />+Different endings create a twist.<br />+Characters have a lot of depth.<br />+Eerie Atmosphere accompanied with Amazing Artstyle<br /><br />Cons<br />-Long adventure may tire some people out.<br />-Town is somewhat small; not many places to explore.\n",

      "One word of advice... Never EVER throw out the original card, and copy the code in numerous safe locations just in case.  I purchased the xbox and this gold membership card last week.  I set it up on Friday, entered the redemption code, and played COD online with my friends for three days.  It was perfect.  Thinking everything was all set, I foolishly threw away the card.  I went to sign on to xbox live on Monday, and it had somehow downgraded me to the silver membership (which means no online gaming anymore).  I called up customer service and spent 3.45 hours explaining over and over to six different customer service representatives what had happened.  No one could help me.  They had no record that I had ever had a gold membership, and because I didn't have the code, they were completely uncooperative.  The most frustrating part is that they also could not explain to me how I was able to play online for three days.  They seemed simply unwilling to believe me and unwilling to believe that there could possibly ever be an error in the system that would allow for this to happen.  Microsoft?  Errors?  NOoooo!  It was the most frustrating experience I've ever had with any customer service.  I told them I could give them the receipt that proved that I had purchased the gold card, but they would not consider that a viable option.  No one was willing to go beyond the standard protocol and see what they could do to help me.  They simply repeated everything that I could already find out just from signing on to xbox live on my own computer.  Waste of time and money.  I'm not saying anything against this product itself.  When it works, it's fabulous.  Just be safe when you buy this, and pray that you don't need to call customer service for any reason.  Don't let them screw you like they did me.\n",

      "I've been a huge fan of the music game genre since Guitar Hero III and the original Rock Band hit the scene around 2007. I always admired Harmonix's Rock Band games over Activision/Neversoft's Guitar Hero series, due in large part to the ability to keep the songs you purchase from installment to installment. Guitar Hero didn't really nail this aspect of the rhythm genre.<br /><br />After a hiatus, Harmonix has 'finished' Rock Band 4 and released it to the public. The word 'finished' I want to use loosely though, because Rock Band 4 is in a pretty barebones condition out of the box when compared to its predecessors. But let's start with the positives (I'm reviewing the PS4 version):<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-The gameplay is as great as it's ever been. Rock Band has never really been a looker, but this entry looks incredibly crisp and it just feels good to play.<br />-New gameplay additions like &#34;Freestyle Solos&#34; on guitar and &#34;Dynamic Fills&#34; on drums are more of a novelty than anything, but they're nonetheless enjoyable to mess around with, especially when playing with friends. I usually switch them off when playing solo (I like playing the song's actual solos and drum fills when I play), but they're entertaining nonetheless.<br />-The microphone and its build quality. This is a huuuuge step up from the last few mics packaged with Rock Band. It has much better pitch detection and the game even allows you to improvise vocals when playing on Hard or Expert, as long as what you're singing is relatively on-key. The vocals work incredibly well. I wish the same attention to detail was applied to the guitar and drum build quality. But we'll get to that momentarily.<br />-The game is built to evolve, and thus far, Harmonix has been very good about updating the game's features every month. One such update released this December that allowed the ability to import all the Rock Band 3 songs into the game for 15 bucks. So if you owned Rock Band 3 on your last gen console, you can export all 85+ of those songs into Rock Band 4. Harmonix released an update in January that allowed the ability to import the RB1 songs as well. The disc exports for RB2, GDRB, and LRB are forthcoming sometime in 2016. (Update 07/24/2016 - RB2, LRB, and GDRB can all be imported now too).<br />-The music store is vibrant and there's literally something for everyone. New songs become available for purchase every week, and usually they're pretty good selections.<br />-Works with your last generation instruments and song library. This is a huge selling point and it's the reason I made the purchase. Just make sure those instruments and song libraries come from the same console manufacturer as the one you have now. For example, PS3 to PS4 or Xbox 360 to Xbox One. If you owned a 360 and you're trying to get this game for PS4, your old instruments and song library you had on the 360 will NOT work on PS4. Your PS3 instruments/songs won't work on Xbox One, either.<br />-The career mode is fun and engaging, although it isn't much different from Rock Band 2's campaign. Still, it's fun to grow as a band and accumulate fans and money over the course of your career. Rock Band nails this feeling perfectly.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-The setlist is weak. I suppose there's not much Harmonix could've done about this since Rock Band has already secured thousands of songs for purchase in the online music library, but it's still a downer. I feel it would've been much more interesting if Harmonix had just released the base game with no songs, and then provided a free 40-50-song credit to use in the music store. That way we could build our own setlists and not shell out for the setlist on the base game. Don't get me wrong, the on-disc setlist is certainly fun to play, but there aren't many big-hitters on this one and it's certainly the weakest of the past games.<br />-The music store was a mess at launch. After multiple tests, it frequently drops connection to the server and boots me to the main menu, so you'd better get in and buy what you need to buy fast once you load up the store. Some songs don't download properly the first time you buy them. One time I had to sign into my PSN account on a PC in order to redownload my purchased songs onto my PS4. It's a huge mess and this is something I really hope they fix. As of April 2016, this still occasionally happens and it's super frustrating.<br />-The Instruments: Wowee. These instruments would be freaking amazing if it weren't for the unreliable Bluetooth connection and the out-of-date firmware they ship with. Out of the box, the drums occasionally drop kick pedal notes and, less frequently, some of the tom notes as well. Not so noticeable if you're playing on Easy-Medium, but can become a real pain in the butt on Hard-Expert. Much worse is the guitar, which frequently does not detect strumming. Hammer-ons and pull-offs seem to work fine, but the strum bar detection is off. Really sucks because both instruments feel phenomenal build-wise, but the connection is really shaky. I don't know how they shipped in this condition, honestly, especially considering I never had any of these problems with prior RB instruments. Please note that there ARE firmware updates available online for the instruments that address these issues. BUTTT my PC doesn't have Bluetooth compatibility, so if you're in the same boat, you're going to have to shell out another 10-20 bucks for a Bluetooth adapter to update those instruments. If your PC/Mac is not Bluetooth-compatible, you'd better be willing to pay a bit extra for your instrument functionality (Update 7/25/2016 - a new Band in the Box Bundle will be released with the Rivals expansion in the fall, so these comments apply specifically to the older instruments currently available, not the new ones due out soon).<br />-NO practice mode. How in the world did they think this was okay? In prior games, you could practice any of the songs in your library, slowing the time and making sure you perfected that complicated riff. But in this game, there's no training mode to speak of. That's a tremendous oversight. (Update: Harmonix finally patched this feature into the game for free in June 2016).<br />-NO online play. Supposedly very few people used this feature last-gen, but it's still a selling point that isn't here out of the box. Harmonix is working on an update that will add online play back, but for now it's totally absent. (Update: Online play is coming, but will be a part of the paid expansion pack &#34;Rivals&#34; in the fall. I'll have to pay 30 extra dollars for the expansion if I want this feature in the game, which is a huge disappointment IMO. More details on Rivals below).<br />-EXTREMELY LIMITED character customization. You get like eight head shapes to choose from, you can't customize the shape of your character's body (so everyone in this game is as thin as a toothpick), and on startup, there are about 7-10 hairstyles you can pick. I think you can unlock more hairstyles as you move through the campaign, but still... Good luck making your character look anything like you. There are so few customization options, it's laughable. Especially for a game that begs you to make your band your own. (Update 07/24/2016 - There are no planned patches that will address character customization in 2016. Harmonix recently confirmed in a reddit thread that they had no development plans for improved character customization at this time).<br /><br />----------<br /><br />In summary, it's pretty apparent that this game was rushed to market. The whole thing is a rickety, barebones mess out of the box. It's not until numerous software/firmware updates that the game functions the way it was intended to, and even then it's lacking in features compared to its predecessors. If Harmonix had just waited another year and added these features fresh out of the box, I have a feeling it would've reviewed better and made a much bigger impact than it has now.<br /><br />As a brief aside: this is also an alarming indication of where the video game industry is headed lately: &#34;release the game now and fix it later.&#34; I understand the need for patching games and doing so to fix unforeseen bugs, but when a game isn't finished, it isn't finished, and it shouldn't be released yet. I think it was a mistake to release this game in the condition it's in, and my review is going to reflect that.<br /><br />Because the game is unfinished, my review is also going to be unfinished. I'll keep it at two stars for now, and should they decide to add stuff later on, I might bump it up a star or two. But I'll never give a five star review for the game, because it was shamefully rushed to market, and Harmonix/MadCatz should've known better. I will &#34;patch&#34; this review with my impressions should they change.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: 1/25/2016 - Well, I updated the firmware on my guitar and drums and here's what I've discovered. First of all, the firmware updating process is a tremendous hassle. Using a Bluetooth adapter for my PC to update the instrument firmware, the update just would not apply to the instruments. It would get to a certain point in the installation and then the guitar would disconnect from my PC. After hours of trying to figure out why, I tried unplugging and replugging the Bluetooth adapter from my PC numerous times DURING the update process, and somehow the update finally stuck. This was downright absurd and it was almost enough for me to drop my review to one star. On top of all that, I found out the strum detection on my guitar was not a firmware issue, but a hardware issue. Sooooo, I'm going to contact MadCatz customer support to see if they will ship me a new one. If they don't, I'll be dropping this review to one star. Never have I had this much hassle with the hardware for a music game. If you purchase the band in a box bundle, hopefully you have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATE: 1/27/2016 - Upon contacting the customer service reps at MadCatz, they agreed to ship me a new guitar free of charge. This is a bright spot in the otherwise pitiful mess it's been to get all the instruments up and running the way they're supposed to. Kudos to MadCatz for, at the bare minimum, a short and painless time on the phone and a free replacement. Will update again soon to let you know how it works.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/25/2016 - The replacement guitar works fine and I was able to update the firmware on it using the trick I detailed above. Good stuff. I purchased the cymbal attachment for the drums and Pro Drums works great. Also, Harmonix has organized the main menu a little more, and added support for creating and saving setlists of songs. Awesome! And finally, at PAX East this month, Harmonix detailed their roadmap for Rock Band 4 releases for the rest of the year. Here are the planned releases:<br />-May - Battleborn characters and double kick pedal support<br />-June - The long-anticipated Practice Mode<br />-Fall - An expansion pack of some kind, plus some music library enhancements<br />-Holiday - Synchronous online multiplayer.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/25/2016 - RIVALS: So, I figured I would come back and detail Harmonix's expansion for Rock Band 4 this fall. It's called Rivals, and apparently it gets you a new single player campaign called &#34;Rockudrama&#34;, which is a mockumentary about your band's rise to fame, and (at last) includes online multiplayer. All this comes at the cost of 30 dollars and this expansion is what entitles you to &#34;free&#34;  updates going forward into 2017. Rivals will be bundled free with future versions of RB4 that have the &#34;Rivals&#34; logo on the box, but pre-existing users will have to shell out the 30 dollars if they still want content updates. So basically, don't buy this game now. Wait until the Rivals bundle comes out this fall so you can get a better version of it.<br /><br />Obviously, I'm incredibly disappointed that, to get RB4 even remotely close content-wise to its predecessors, it took not only months of small content updates, but now it's going to take an extra $30 if I want the online functionality? I feel like a freakin beta tester for this game. I paid full price for it the first year, and ended up with defective instruments, a hasslesome online store, and lack of content. Now Harmonix expects to charge me even more for me to stay in the loop, which certainly doesn't really make me feel respected as an early adopter. But I guess that's the way it works being an early adopter of anything in the tech world really.<br /><br />Well I think I'm nearing the end of my &#34;updates&#34;  to this review, and I think two stars is still a good representation of my attitude towards this game. I'll just say this: if you're lucky enough to have waited on the sidelines for the first year, Fall 2016 will be the time to get this game. You'll get to buy a new Rivals band bundle with better instruments, more content, and the promise of future updates. You'll even get to import all of your previous disc exports if you used the export keys last gen! Man I am envious of you if that's you! Because you know what I got when I paid $200 for this game? A big heaping pile of trash. (Okay, maybe that's a bit extreme). Really though, RB4 was an unequivocally broken mess when it launched in 2015, and with Rivals, it's finally becoming the successor it was intended to be. But because Harmonix/Madcatz shoved the game out the doors before it was even finished just to compete with Guitar Hero Live, sans every conceivable feature that would've made this game a worthy successor to Rock Band 3, I have lost a significant amount of respect for Harmonix, and I don't plan to be an early adopter of their games ever again.\n",

While I, too, can appreciate the work that went into these games (Schizm and Exile, for example, were absolutely, drop-dead gorgeous), in the end, they all felt like they missed out on being truly good games. Mostly it was because the developers failed to integrate good, challenging puzzles into their games. To make their puzzles seem difficult, they would often times resort to pixel-hunting or poorly-conceived &quot;lateral-thinking&quot; puzzles. All the lateral thinking in the world couldn't come up with what they were after most times.  Hardly a game went by where my wife and I didn't have to resort to getting hints or checking a walk-through to help us past some of these stinker puzzles.<br />In RHEM, we never once had to take a peek at a hint or walk-through. That is not to say that all of the puzzles in RHEM were too easy. Some of them were quite hard, in fact, but overall they were the best, most integrated puzzles we have seen since Riven. We got really stuck in a few places, but each time we resisted the urge to find help because we knew, up to that point, the rest of the game had made perfect sense and we were just missing some crucial, but obvious, clue from somewhere else. After finally figuring these tough ones out, my wife and I were often hugging each other or giving each other high-fives! And, at the end of the game, we were truly disappointed that it was over because we were having so much fun.<br />Other reviewers have said they were put off by the &quot;low-tech&quot; look and feel of your game. Initially, we kind of felt the same way after playing so many of the spit-and-polished games recently. But, that feeling quickly faded once we saw the true beauty of it. Soon we weren't even missing the background music, lush 3-D graphics and full-motion videos of the other games (and don't get me started on the voices and actors!). We were totally absorbed in the puzzles within puzzles on top of puzzles. One other thing these reviewers obviously didn't realize was that this game was developed entirely by one single person. That is a huge feat in today's world.<br />We hear that you are hard at work on a sequel to RHEM and eagerly await the results. We know that, being an independent developer, it will probably take a while to finish it. But, some things are worth the wait. In the mean time, we will continue to support the first-person adventure game genre by playing the other games coming out soon, but I will wager that none of them will fulfill our high standards until we play your next offering.<br />Best regards,<br />...\n",

      "The Sims 3: Generations is the fourth expansion pack the the Sims 3 series and I must say, it's pretty good. I got it on the day of its release via Amazon. Now I'm no game reviewer as I'm more of a music reviewer (aspiring music journalist here) but I'll try my best to describe this game. Like with most expansion packs for the Sims, make sure you got your favorite families or games backed up on CD-Rs or whatever you back them up on. I've been doing this since Ambitions came out a year ago since I learned the hard way when one of the sims in my family wasn't moving. Alright, now to the game itself.<br /><br />The theme for this expansion pack revolves around the idea of life and growing up. I found this interesting for EA to base an entire expansion pack on. What about the users who like having one sim families? Well, I guess you would get some things out of the new objects. If you're a user who likes to make families and have them go on and on, this might be the expansion pack for you. Your sims will get to keep memories of their lives (examples: Marriage, birth of a child, death, first kiss,prom etc). If you can remember in the Sims 2, your sims did get to have memories. This takes that idea and expands it. Memories can also be shared through the Sims 3 website and even Facebook! The only negative with the memories feature is that it may get annoying after a while. Also, I found this to be a bit funny: after you install the game, your sims will experience their \"firsts\" in just about anything. For example, my teenage sims, just about to be a young adult, kept his memory of his first day in school (when I know it isn't because he's been to school plenty of times before this expansion pack was released!).<br /><br />New features are built around sims for all ages but for some reason, I feel like most of them are targeted for child and teen sims. For child sims, they'll get to have a bunch of new things such as see-saws, slip n slides, tree houses, and other things. There's also the interesting addition of imaginary friends. When your sim is just born, they will receive a gift in the mail. Its a doll, which you can give a name and have your toddler sim play with. As your sim grows up, so does your imaginary friend, based on your relationship. I'm also reading that if you keep a good relationship with your imaginary friend, they can have the chance to become real! For teen sims, they'll get to go to prom and even graduate high school. However, there's one disadvantage here with being a teen sim: teen sims can't automatically drive anymore! They have to now ask their parents for lessons! The lessons don't take very long (like 3 skill points to complete). As for other sims, there's a new chemistry set like thing. You can make potions that can help or hurt your sims. Your sims can also give other sims gifts, which is nice to see return!<br /><br />These are just  a couple of things you can do with The Sims 3: Generations. So far, I'm enjoying it. When you get it and open the case, you might be a little disappointed: there's still no $10 card for the online store, which is easy to get over. However, the booklet that comes with the game is barely even a booklet. I think the same goes for the Outdoor Living stuff pack: it just comes with an installation guide. Personally, the booklets have helped me and seeing this removed is sad. Still, The Sims 3: Generations is a great addition to the Sims 3 series.\n",

      "These CGI short films are collected from Blizzard games of the past few years - Starcraft, Diablo 2, and Warcraft 3.  Great games in their own right, fans were amazed that the cinematics reached Hollywood-level quality.  Early work in Starcraft was somewhat crude, but Blizzard's latest efforts are the best in the industry, showing subtle lighting effects and beautiful art design.  No feature films, not Shrek or Monsters Inc or Final Fantasy, can match the wonderful mix of realism and exagerated fantasy in Blizzard's work.  I strongly recommend this box set for any Sci-Fi, Fantasy, or gaming fan.<br />The DVDs are seperated, 1 for each game, and they come with standard extras - audio commentary for each film, concept artwork, storyboards, trailers and commercials, and even a Warcraft trivia game.  I delve into each individual DVD below, but....<br />Sadly, this box set is less than perfect.  Blizzard could have - should have - combined everything onto 1 DVD, there is so little material here.  Instead, you get the same 3 DVDs already available for each of these games: the Starcraft DVD and the 2 DVDs from the collectors' editions of Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3.  If you own these things already, you'll discover nothing new here.<br />Blizzard's greatest crime was to forget the cinematics for the Diablo 2 expansion, Lord of Destruction.  You won't find it in this collection.  The story for each game is hard to follow for anyone who hasn't played the games (although the audio commentary sometimes helps).  Also, the enhanced resolution for these movies isn't that much of an improvement - Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3 films look virtually the same, and Starcraft movie improve TOO much, such that their faults from old-age show through.<br />STARCRAFT:  This DVD is the oldest, and the crudest, the simplest.  However, it is interesting to watch Blizzard's artists grow, and the films are still entertaining, especially a Marine investigation on a science vessel that turns into a 5 minute remake of Aliens.  The films from the Starcraft Expansion are considerably improved, more complex, more atmospheric. The story involves 3 races in a galactic war, with a huge cast of characters and events.  The human Terrans are at war with each other when the organic Zerg horde attacks, while the mysterious Protoss wait in the shadows.  The commentary will help you figure out the plot, and is entertaining in itself.<br />DIABLO 2: This is easily the best DVD of the 3, because the Diablo movies are the most compelling, most visually striking, and they tell a complete story, which runs parallel to the players' quest in the game.  It follows the tragic failure of the Wanderer, a hero who once defeated Diablo, Lord of Terror, only to become possessed and later consumed by the demon.  The films show incredible battles, one between Diablo and beautiful archangel Tyreal, and another in a burning inn, with skeletons and other nightmares leaping straight from the flames.<br />The game ended in a cliffhanger, and Blizzard choose not to include the films from the later expansion which resolved this.  However, the teaser trailers for Diablo 2 are the best \"new\" material in the box set, because they show things you won't find in the game.  There is also some early Blizzard CGI work, from Diablo 1 and Warcraft 2.  Watch this, THEN watch Starcraft, and you'll understand why we were so excited when SC first came out.<br />WARCRAFT 3:  While WC3 is the newest and technically the best of the DVDs, I feel that the artistic direction was somehow a step backwards for this game.  The WC3 films are bright and very, very beautiful, but somehow they don't stand as \"tall\" as Diablo 2.<br />Warcraft 3, like Starcraft, has multiple races at war with each other.  The human kingdoms are fighting each other when the Undead Scourge attack suddenly, all while the mysterious Night Elves wait in the shadows (sound familiar?).  The orcs travel on a journey of racial freedom, and eventually join forces with the Elves and Humans to drive back a demonic invasion from another dimension, the Burning Legion.<br />Most of the films are very good, but those that feature the lord of the Burning Legion are boring, especially the climax of the story and the game, which was a major letdown.  The audio commentary is also boring, getting lost in obscure technical details and not telling enough of the story to follow along.  A Warcraft trivia game is a nice extra, though.<br />There, I hope I gave enough information... =)\n",

      "I play a lot of Resistance 2 and COD4 & COD:WAW. Resistance for its massive battles & COD for the great graphics and super tight play. Killzone 2 is a great blend of each.<br /><br />There are a lot of complaints about the controls, but none from me. The guns are weighted and recoil as you would expect. The characters move like heavily armored soldiers carrying heavy artillary might. I could see it as an issue if it wasn't equal, but everyone is playing at the same speed and after a very short amount of time, I can say without fail that I am pretty quick with the M82 and plenty of online players that are far superior to me will light you up as quick as any game of Halo or COD.<br /><br />As far as the graphics, online there is no dropoff compared to the single player. This is the best looking game I can remember playing. I had a difficult time going back to Resistance because it looked terrible after KZ2.<br /><br />The single player game is ...about like every other signle player FPS that I can remember. Follow a line shoot guys, etc. I only played for a couple of hours to get familiar with the controls before playing online so I can't really speak as an authority on the single player.<br /><br />The online game has all of the usual suspects as far as game modes go. The new exception is being able to string any of the five together that plays as single game. If you have a squad that you enjoy playing with, this is great. If you jump into a 25 minute game and get stuck with a team of half-tards, prepare to be frustrated that you have to wait 25 minutes to get credited with your experience. It's also worth noting that KZ2 has a similiar level up / xp system that unlocks various items like COD 4. It's about what you'd expect.The battles are awesome and where KZ2 really takes the cake for me is the whole package with 30 people at a time. My biggest complaint with COD4 is 12 player battles on medium sized maps. It is too easy for people to camp and the middle of the screen remain empty for extended periods - especially in hardcore modes where you are playing 1 shot kills.<br /><br />Killzone 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel and doesn't really offer anything new in terms of gameplay. A similiar thing has happened with the fighter genre. You can only \"play guns\" in so many different ways, so the next logical step is perfecting the genre, and right now, Killzone 2 is at the top of the heap.<br /><br />UPDATED:<br />I purchased the downloadable map packs, Titanium & Steel. One takes place on a moving train, the other in the cruiser shown at the opening of the game. The train is a sight to behold and a snipers dream come true as the action funnels to visible choke points and the map is very narrow. The Vekta cruiser is multi-leveled and circular in shape. It's a stark contrast to the rest of Killzone with bright lighting and vibrant colors. The pack cost $6.00 and both are fun to play. The only problem is not many people appear to have purchased. It is common to find lobbies with the new map pack OR the originals. They're great to see in motion, espcially the train, but not a mandatory purchase at all.<br /><br />I have such a problem with connection, that I've found myself going back to COD4 & WAW despite preferring Killzone 2's gameplay. Not only am I frequently disconnected, but it logs the PS3 offline and occassionaly locks up the system and requires a hard restart. I've even found myself having to restart my router becuase it locks everything up and I have to reboot my connection. It is exceptionally frustrating to play partial matches and get kicked (especially the longer games) and pop in COD or Resistance and have no issues.<br /><br />Finally - Clan battles. Ugh. Oddly enough, COD felt like you had to be in a clan to enjoy the game. In fact, it's almost mandatory (log into a match with just a bunch of guys versus a party and get ready to die...a lot, no level balancing). KZ seems to be the opposite. Clan battles have rampant cheating and cheapness you just don't see in the big open matches. I played in a couple clan matches and virtually every negative I'd heard about them was evident(not respawning in deathmatch, hiding the the radio in your base, etc.). I've had a much better time just going from game to game until I find a group that is competitive on both sides. The good rooms are typically set to automatically balance, so a room with a few good players on both sides can be as much fun as any clan battle.\n",

      "When I found out this was available for the Switch, I just knew I would be giving it a five-star review, since this was my absolute all-time favorite PC game when I was a kid.  I did have a wonderful moment of nostalgia being able to play this game again, but the moment was fleeting.  The more I played the game, the more glitches I found.  Here are a few:<br /><br />When you test a custom coaster prior to opening it, the ratings shown end up being lower once you open the coaster to the public.  This can be a problem on scenarios where your goal is to make coasters of specific ratings.  Also, the game resets track lengths to zero meters, which is why it will tell you to \"Finish building your coaster!\" when you click on coasters you've already built.  This causes a problem on scenarios where your goal is to have coasters of a specific track length - you will have to finish those scenarios in one sitting, because if you save and close the game the lengths will be zero when you reload that saved game.  Adding too many Special tracks to a custom coaster can crash the game during the build phase.  If you choose the Tropical Custom Station for a custom coaster, it will crash the game when you go to save and exit.  The color of the Maze always reverts to white as soon as you place it, you will have to manually change it back to green.  The path builder always switches your perspective to North-facing no matter which way you were facing when you selected it.  (All of the other building options keep your current perspective when you choose them.)  Placing rides and restaurants and shops will remove forest terrain for you, but paths won't; you'll have to use the Erase tool on the forest terrain before placing paths.<br /><br />Other problems include the fact that no matter how big your park is or how wealthy you are, you can never, ever build more than 10 coasters in any one park.  And in the biggest parks you can never zoom out far enough to see the whole park at once.  Also, you can't rename anything, whereas in the PC game you could rename everything.  In this version everything you build will be numbered, like Wooden Coaster 1, Wooden Coaster 2, etc.  In the PC game, you built the coaster piece by piece as you went, but now you have to outline the general path first from start to finish, then go back into each node and change each node separately to a different track type.  This makes adding track tilts etc much more tedious - and pointless - than in the PC version.<br /><br />Instead of custom coasters, you can place pre-designed ones.  The problem with these is that even though they have their own names and logos in the selection screen (\"The Pacemaker\" etc) when you place them, they all have the same default station (all of the wooden coasters have the Mount Timber station etc) and are still called Wooden Coaster 1, Wooden Coaster 2, etc, instead of the pre-designed name the game has given them.<br /><br />You can choose which category to research, but not specific items.  If your customers demand an Asian restaurant, you can only choose to research \"a\" restaurant, and you might get anything from a food stand to an Italian bistro; you can't make the game research the Sushi stand specifically, for example.  And you can't cancel research that is underway, so if you meant to choose the $7000 research option but accidentally chose the $70,000 option, there's no way to undo your mistake, your $70k is irretrievably gone.  Some of the rides are practically identical, like the Flying Carpet and the Magic Carpet.  For some reason the Hot Dog Stand is always the last food stand the game gives you in every scenario, maybe the game designers hate hot dogs?  Speaking of biases, there are over 20 flags you can place as decorations, but there are no Asian countries' flags at all, and only Kenya and South Africa from the African continent, and no Greece.<br /><br />There are four modes to choose from, each of which have problems:<br />TUTORIAL: this is only partly helpful, because not all of the icons and menus are explained.<br />ADVENTURE: there are four options to choose from, but they are all exactly the same.  As you play, you will be presented with some A-or-B choice questions.  Sometimes there is a \"good\" answer and a \"bad\" answer, but other times both answers are \"bad\" and you will be negatively impacted no matter what you choose.  The questions are identical in each of the four adventures, so there's no point playing all four.<br />SCENARIOS: there are sixteen to choose from (5 easy, 6 medium, 5 difficult), some of which are affected by the glitches mentioned above.  Some of the scenarios take place on the moon, yet the hot air balloon and the airplane still \"fly\" over the park, which makes no sense.<br />SANDBOX: in this mode you choose CREATIVE or CAREER.  Creative means you have infinite money and everything is already researched, so you can build whatever you want whenever you want, but because you have infinite money, you don't get the satisfaction of earning any profit.  Career is like the scenarios but without any goals or time limits, which sounds nice but you are still subject to the randomness of the research tree; you have to wait until something has been researched before you can build it.<br /><br />The best sandbox option would be one where everything is already researched (like Creative) but you can still grow a profit (like Career), but the game doesn't come with this option.  It would also be nice if there were more themes.  You get Western, Sci-Fi, and Tropical (with one Entertainer for each), but there's no medieval theming, no candyland theming, etc.<br /><br />Having said all that, why am I still giving this game three stars?  Because it's still fun to design and build your own amusement park.  Also, unlike the PC game, which had strict physics rules when placing tracks, the coaster tracks in this version don't count, they're like ghost-tracks.  You only need to worry about where to place the station in the park; tracks from multiple coasters can overlap the same physical point on the map and the game doesn't care, because the tracks aren't really there.  It's also tremendous fun changing the colors of the rides and even the food stands: you can make the Bubble Tea purple, the Cotton Candy green, the Candy Apples black, etc, it's entirely up to you.  There are 55 colors to choose from, which is far more than are needed especially since you can't zoom in very close on the park.  And the game marks which items you've placed and which ones you haven't, and if you build something but then remove it, it marks it as being unplaced again, which is very helpful since you're going to want to place everything, especially in the biggest parks.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you know going into it how buggy it can be, it can still be fun to play.

      "On the cover of the 360 and ps3 version it says &#34;Be The Story&#34;. The problem is,this ONLY applies to the Xbox One and ps4 copies of NBA 2K16. The Spike Lee story is only on those games and NOT on the last generation versions. You'd think 2K wouldn't have had &#34;Be The Story&#34; on the cover of the 360 and ps3 games,to let us know that it wasn't included...but no. This is complete and utter DECEPTION and FALSE ADVERTISING! So...what else do we have(or don't have) here...? Basically just the SAME game as NBA 2K13,NBA 2K14 and NBA 2K15. Nothing new except for a current roster update. That's basically it. We don't even get any of the new classic teams in this watered down piece of crap! This is just ridiculous! 2K has milked last generation owners once again,with a lackluster waste of money. What's sad is,many people who can't afford a next generation console,bought this game for 60 bucks(which is the SAME PRICE as the Xbox One and PS4 version) hoping to get something new,that they didn't get in NBA 2K15,but instead..basically got the same freaking game! It would've been easy for 2K to simply tell us that these new features were only to be added to next generation. This would've gave us a heads up,as to what we were getting. But of course,they wouldn't do that,because all they care about is the $$$$$ money $$$$$. I highly recommend that you don't spend ONE single cent on this crap!\n",

      "I am giving this game two stars - one for the graphics and one for the first half of the game. As already mentioned, the graphics in this game rival those of Syberia I and II. The details are incredible: the fine grain of the wood, individual hairs on the characters' heads or the leaves on a tree branch. In addition the colors were rich and vibrant. I was really encouraged by the graphics and the storyline for the first half of the game: A wealthy Englishman is murdered in front of a hundred witnesses at a party being held for his daughter with whom he has been estranged. In fact, the initial suspect is his daughter. In typical adventure gameplay you, as Sherlock Holmes (and occasionally Watson), wander throughout the deceased's house and other locations collecting and examining clues and interviewing witnesses. While collecting evidence Holmes encounters a number of puzzles.<br /><br />One puzzle involves placing numbered pieces on board resembling a chessboard so that each column and row of numbers adds up to the same total - very logical and easy (although time consuming) game. Another puzzle involves placing animal statues into \"Noah's Ark\" in the correct order. This is a more difficult puzzle and requires examining a few clues for the answer. However, two other puzzles (a card game and the combination to a safe) made no sense to me even after consulting a walkthrough. But even that wasn't as bad as the puzzles that occur during the second half of the game.<br /><br />These are timed puzzles. For the first puzzle Holmes has to get from one location to another without being caught by a guard and a watch dog. One problem with the puzzle is that the characters of Holmes, the dog and the guard are only about the size of a gnat, making them almost impossible to distinguish. Another problem was that I could not figure out where Holmes was supposed end up. The only way I could figure out this puzzle was with a walkthrough along with a whole lot of persistence. It had to have taken me a dozen or more attempts to get Holmes where he needed to go without being detected. I found this so frustrating and it made me so angry that the rest of the game was ruined for me. After all, adventure games are supposed to be fun - not make you want to throw your computer out the window (instead I threw my mouse across the room). But wait - once you get Holmes to his destination successfully, and he is done there, there's a similar timed puzzle to get him to a second location without detection.<br /><br />Then, just as you think (and hope) that this was the last of the timed puzzles, you're stuck with another one. In this puzzle, Holmes goes through a maze set in a forest and then needs to retrace his steps to fetch a pail of water to put out a fire. This wouldn't have been too bad except that Holmes can be very difficult to manipulate at times. Theoretically, the player should just half to click on an icon (a set of footprints) to get Holmes to move. Unfortunately, Holmes doesn't always move when this icon is clicked or the icon doesn't appear at all (or is difficult to locate - a couple of times it is located on Holmes's body). This makes moving Holmes quickly through a maze very frustrating. It took me another dozen or more attempts to accomplish this task (this time I only screamed obscentities at my computer). Even though I was mad, frustrated and disappointed I had to finish the game to find out who the killers are (a few more bodies pile up during the game). Once all the clues are gathered it is time for Holmes to reveal the killers. But instead of a nice tight conclusion Holmes rambles on for at least fifteen minutes - the answer was so convoluted and contrived that I lost interest - even taking a bathroom break, only to come back to find Holmes still going on and on and on.<br /><br />This is a game I was really looking forward to. The first half of the game was very promising but then it took a dramatic turn for the worse - I cannot recommend it.\n",

      "I was a little skeptical about buying this.<br />It was VERY confusing on how to set up, but eventually, I was able to get it.<br />( Steps for PC )<br />1. Put disk 1 in and once your computer pulls up the options double click \" Open folder to view files \"<br /><br />2. In the folder, there should be an orange icon with the title \" Setup \", double click the file and once it opens it will tell you to hit continue and it will start to download Origin. ( You can trust Origin to download, don't worry. :) )<br /><br />3. Once it's done downloading, it should give you a few tabs asking you if your computer should trust it to download. ( This can take up to 10 - 15 minutes )<br /><br />4. After it's done downloading and you have allowed it to download, it should give you a tab to login and create your account. If you don't have an account it's easy to create one, just fill out the information and hit accept.<br /><br />5. After creating your account, Origin should ask you to verify even more tabs to let it update, after, let Origin open, it can take a few minutes to load, at the top it will ask you to verify your email, click verify and the email should send within a couple minutes. Origin WILL probably crash even if you hit \" Not now \" to the email verification notification, now is when you should restart your computer.<br /><br />6. After your computer has restarted, and you have verified your email, ( Usually the verification won't work for your account when Origin is open so I recommend verifying it when it's closed ) open Origin and if it logged you out log back in. Then you should be able to download The Sims.<br /><br />7.  Now, once you're logged in, there should be an option to hit \" My Game Library \" on the left. Click on it and on the the top right there should be an option to click \" Add a game \". Open product case ( The disk case ) and there is a code for you to redeem, enter the code in Origin and there you have it!<br /><br />I hope this was helpful to you. :)<br />It takes about 1 - 2 hours to download after putting in the code so I would just let it download while you're doing something else.\n",

      "I have been waiting for this game for quite a while...and know what?<br />It's just what I hoped it would be and even more!<br /><br />As I started playing the game I just could not quit laughing. The Bard is a dirty ol' [...] and will say some of the nastyest and funniest things ever.<br /><br />But let's examine the game:<br /><br />1) Graphics 8/10: could be better, but what you need is there and many features are way above genre average.<br />2) Sound 10/10: FX and music are very good, voice acting is EXCEPTIONAL.<br />3) Gameplay: 8/10 very good but some overall flaws.<br />*For one the saving system is a nuisance and I don't understand while it is still around (find the tome and save only at the \"tome point\").<br />*The fighting system is ok (if somewhat more difficult than your typical Baldur's Gate for console) and you must not only rely on your sword but mostly on your summons and on finding out how to complement each other skills. You can't just go around bashing everything to pieces.<br />*The camera however is a bit of a pain. Way up in the sky, you see your character from above with no possibility of angle changing. Sometimes with trees around it gets somewhat frustrating.<br />*The \"answer interaction\" system is great and more games should adopt it. When you talk with people you don't have a set of \"phrases\" to choose from, you simply choose your attitude. This will affect how non playing characters (i.e. those you interact with) will perceive your Bard and how they will treat him. Being rude pays off sometimes.<br />4) Storyline 20 out of 10: AHAHAAHAHAHA... this game will just have you laughing, and laughing and laughing. The story is funny, very original and well delivered to you by a sarcastic narrator. I won't spoil the game here, you'll have to believe me. Just play the first 5 minutes and the laughing will start.<br /><br />Bottomline:<br />Overall I would suggest this game to:<br />1. anybody who likes or has a grasp for RPGs.<br />2. anybody who likes humorous games<br />3. RPGers tired of the old cliche' games<br />4. all fans of non-politically correctness<br />5. any old school RPG gamer. The more RPGs you've played in the past the more you will laugh here.<br /><br />In general I'd suggest this game to anybody who likes games. It's just fun to see something original and enjoyable.\n",

      "This game is not as bad as people make it out to be. I have played almost all the need for speed games so I know what I am talking about. Firstly the bad: the voice acting is really BAD. I actually have the voice volume at zero and I turned on subtitles because it was that bad. One thing that makes it worse is that they will randomly start talking while you are driving around. Second is the upgrade system, you upgrade performance parts by either earning speed cards at the end of a race or by buying them at a tune up shop. This wouldn't be that bad except it is completely RANDOM and each one you get can only be used on the car you won that race with. You can save the card for later but you can't use it on any other car. The tune up shop where you can buy speed cards has random cards that are refreshed every 30min. Those are the major bad points in the game that are something that would bother most people. Now for the good: the handling mechanics are actually pretty good, way better than 2015's game. It does have a different feel but it isn't bad. The map I think is another strong point. It has a city area, desert area, and kind of an in between area. It is really the biggest map in any NFS game. The graphics aren't exactly a super strong point. I play on PS4 pro and even if it runs at 4k there are still jaggies and the textures aren't much of an improvement over the last game. I am kind of disappointed by this seeing how good other games are able to look on the pro. Even after all this I gave it four stars because this game is still fun and even if it is a bit of a grind to make any kind of progression I enjoyed the grind. If you don't mind the bad points of this game and are just looking for a fun need for speed I totally recommend this game to you.<br />EA has updated some things in this game so I will update my review accordingly. First the tune up shop refreshed every 10 min down from 30min. They have changed the speed cards a bit so now if you go to the tune up shop the parts are a higher level than what are currently equipped on your car. Instead of only some being higher. The same goes for the speed cards after you win a race. You now gain more bank and rep from races. This really helps progression because now you don't have to grind old races nearly as much. I am not sure if this is a bug but I was playing a race and all of a sudden a cop starts chasing us. Maybe they're adding cops in free roam? Overall these are good changes and it actually enticed me to play the game a lot more.\n",

      "The Silent Hill series of video games is one of the best of its genre. With the exception of SH 3, which has more of a blockbustery feel to it, the original game and its sequel, Silent Hill 2, have done more to further the genre of Survival Horror than any other series of games, making Capcom's Resident Evil/Biohazard series look slow and tired.<br />We start off with James Sunderland, a shell of a man since his wife Mary's death, three years before, lost in thought in a bathroom on the outskirts of town. He's come back to SIlent Hill, a resort town full of happy memories for himself and his wife, because he has received a letter from her, saying she will meet him in their 'special place'. And from there, you're pretty much left to piece the story together yourself, thanks to ingenious plot twists and the best characterisation since Final Fantasy 7.<br />The graphics are wonderful. Fuzzy, murky streets and rooms harbour beautifully-rendered, totally ambiguous creatures that scare us becuase of what we cannot see. The superhuman, exaggerated animation of the mannequins and nurses add to the unnatural atmosphere pervading the game. The cut-scene renders are actually beautiful, with Maria and James' exchange in the underground Toluca Prison levels being one of the most riveting pieces of FMV ever. The sound, too, adds greatly to the experience, with grunts, bangs and screams punctuating the sometimes-deafening silence. Because of the game mechanics, what you hear is oftentimes more important than what you see (or believe you see) and it's this, coupled with the storyline and characters, that characterises the unique psychological tension found in this game.<br />The game mechanics are simple to come to terms with and prove themselves after fifteen minutes or so of play time: you don't notice them anymore.<br />A word on what makes SH 2 such a wonderful experience - Characters like Laura, an enigmatic child who claims to know Mary, Eddie Dombrowski, an unhinged giant of a man whose attitude towards cold-blooded murder gives a realistic slant to the psychological horror, and Maria, the sensual and schizophrenic doppelganger of James' dead wife, are so well-realised that we see new characteristics in them each time the game is played. The character of Angela is a particular mystery, and a testament to the strength of emotion that a videogame can create. On paper, the main villian, Pyramid Head, is nothing special (a giant man with a steel pyramid for a head... literally!) but it's the way he moves and the noises he makes that propel him into the history books as one of the scariest villians anywhere, alongside Biohazard's Hunters and The Exorcist's Pazuzu, in terms of the amount of fear he generates. This is the genius of the game, Konami's developers taking painstaking time and effort with the people that populate the terrifying world of Silent Hill, thereby giving us an unforgettable and compelling cast of characters.<br />The replay value is very high, with five different endings to discover, and new things to see and hear each time, every trip you make to Silent Hill 2 leaves you with something new from this bizarre and macabre universe.<br />A word for fans of action-based violence: you'll be disappointed. SH 2 is a story-based, character-driven game, and if it's violence and gore you need, then this won't do. It's a different kind of scary than Resident Evil, Clock Tower etc. For anyone interested in seeing just how far a game can push the concept of psychological horror, or for anyone who loves to get lost in a storyline, this is one of the best examples you can own.<br />Put simply, Silent Hill 2 is an Opus, a magnificent monster of a game that should held up as a standard-bearer by more than just the videogames industry. It's deep, it's complex, it's engaging, and above all, it's excellent. Thoroughly and unequivocally recommended.\n",

In fact,  when you install Unlimited on a computer that already has the original  3000, you get the option to transfer over files (like all your old cities).  It then even does the uninstall of the old product for you (very nice).  Granted, Unlimited does chew up a bit more disk space so you should make  sure you have room to spare for the new version.<br />I'd also suggest you try  to get in while the rebate is going on.  It will get you back $10 on the  price of Unlimited.  Then you won't feel so bad spending money on a game  you basically already have.  Then do what I did: give your old copy of  SimCity 3000 to a family member to get them hooked on the game.  &lt;grin&gt;\n",

      "**Warning: A couple spoilers**<br /><br />I want to give one spoiler up front but I think it's important to know if you're still going to buy Fable 3.  After you become king it makes you work through a 365 day year BUT it doesn't tell you that last chance you have to make decisions is on day 112.  I had millions in gold at that time in my first play through and it was WASTED because I didn't know I wouldn't get another chance to transfer it into the kingdom treasury.. of course millions died because of it and I felt it ruined my game.  You can't go back because it autosaves and if there's a way to have more than 1 save I haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />I'll start with the only good thing I have to say about Fable 3.  The interplay with Elise and our child was a nice little roleplay feature and the only reason I give even 2 stars.  Elise and Abby I will remember and miss, for the rest I've already printed the trade-in label to send this dog to a new owner.<br /><br />Now then, I found Fable 3 extremely disappointing.  Everything talked about in all the prerelease hype was true... from a certain point of view.<br /><br />Entertaining big name voices?<br /><br />The only one I really paid attention to was John Cleese \"Jarvis\".  Why?  Because practically every time I \"popped\" into my hideout (and you do it for everything from clothing to weapons to quick travel) he was hawking DLC instead of helping me save this world I'm supposed to be so \"immersed\" in.  He sounded more like a used car salesman than a butler, \"Sir I believe there's a new outfit in the store\", \"Sir some new items seem to be available in the store.\"  By the time I finished the game.. for the second time.. I was ready to kill Jarvis and John Cleese too.<br /><br />Interesting combat choices?<br /><br />If by interesting you mean the biggest decision was how long to hold down the B button to area effect fireball every enemy then I guess it was interesting.  The second play through I didn't use magic at all and the decision became how many times should I roll like Sonic the Hedgehog before popping up to take a shot or swing at ever how many creatures my rolling was making dizzy.<br /><br />The story?<br /><br />Who cares?  Politically correct claptrap!  Save the lake, save the marsh, watch over the people because they can't watch over themselves.  As some of the other reviews have stated the first time through I wasn't prepared for needing 10,000,000 GOLD to buy everyone out of trouble.  So, when the swelfare people came calling they didn't care that I was saving them from impending doom and needed a little gold to do so.  On the good side buying every property in the game on the second play through made me so rich that I bought everyone as well.  They all loved me.  After the endgame event I could just bump into anyone on the street and they would instantly give me guild seals and promote themselves to my friend whether I wanted another friend or not.<br /><br />The biggest effect on saving the kingdom was making a few pies then buying all the property in the game and waiting for hours while the gold poured in.  As in real life those with the gold make the rules.. in their favor.. and are still loved for it.<br /><br />The moral choices?<br /><br />Not all they're cracked up to be no matter what choice you make.  First play through I saved the crowd not the girl, got nothing for it.  The second I saved the girl not the crowd and she married someone else when I had to leave the castle.  On the good side they do allow you to become a home wrecker and get her to leave the other man for you.. but my having 9,000,000 gold at that time somewhat painted her as a gold digger in my mind.<br /><br />That being said she was the only time I married during the game in no small part because ALL the other \"Girls of Albion\" looked like they should be eating ALPO.  We did have a child which was interesting but if you playing for the \"mature\" content there really is none.  The screen goes black, you get some random bed squeaks, a few comments that you can hear in normal conversation too, and then the lights turn back on.  I suppose in the consideration of \"immersion\" the girl is normally gone immediately after so I suppose not having to pay them to leave is a plus.<br /><br />With the booze, the women, the stds, etc. I did pull off a reasonable simulation of Charlie Sheen so I guess it can simulate real life after all.<br /><br />No menus?  Sorry there are still menus.<br /><br />You buy property and chose weapons and clothes through menus.  You have to repair any houses you buy and rent out.. through menus.  You can't see weapon stats other than.. through menus.  I also had one bug that froze the game while relocating the family home.  The result?  I now have the old family home back and I've lost all control of the new one.  I can't sell it, can't rent it out, can't repair it, nothing.<br /><br />Living weapons? \"Use your weapon and it will transform!\"<br /><br />B.S.  There are specific miniquests attached to each weapon.  If you don't do the specific mini-quests the weapon never changes.  For example the \"whack-a-mole\" quests like kill 300 hollow men, kill 150 mercenaries, kill 40 nobles, etc etc.  The hero weapons are the same except they don't tell you what the quests are nor what or if any features are added when the unlock occurs.  The only time I saw a weapon transform was each time I opened a new melee \"chest\" on the \"road to rule\" with my experience poin.. wait Fable 3 got away from experience points to use something waaaay better.. guild seals.. which are the same thing.  Also had a bug here where some weapons never opened their new powers after the mini quest was completed and then some.<br /><br />P.S. speaking of the dog... watch him he's on drugs.  He barks then walks in circles for 10-15 seconds before actually walking to the treasure/dig site.  Especially funny at the lake as he dives into the water then shakes himself dry over and over.<br /><br />P.P.S if you want to be good.. don't approve the drinking law.  It's hard to be an angelic being walking through your towns when there are drunks staggering and throwing up all over your streets.. remember kids people can't be trusted to act like adults so it's politically incorrect to let people decide when to use alcohol without big brothers guidance.<br /><br />One last spoiler.. wtf can't you kill Reaver?  He was the only character I wanted to kill as much as Jarvis.\n",

      "The perks of buying the PC version according to Infinity Ward (IW):<br /><br />1. Text chatting. Now you can text chat to your buddies in-game while online, what fantastic innovation.<br /><br />2. Adjustable graphics setting -- gotta give them points for adding that feature, while console users are stuck with their 720/1080 resolution, you can max it up all the way depending on your hardware. Amazing stuff...although every game has had this feature since the beginning of PC gaming.<br /><br />3. The ability to use your mouse and keyboard. Now you can unplug your xbox controller and use your computer accessories for a more accurate FPS experience(!).<br /><br />4. You'll have a fantastic smooth time connecting to IWNet; its so perfect, it'll even give you XBox Live error messages.<br /><br />Now, the negatives:<br /><br />1. You're paying more for an inferior product. $60 vs $50. The consoles have a valid excuse for charging more -- $10.00 goes to the console manufacturer (Sony or Microsoft), Activision is just being greedy here; really quite unacceptable, especially in today's economy.<br /><br />2. Dedicated servers removed -- don't even get me started; I'm sure you've heard of the petition which is nearing 200,000 signatures to re-include dedicated servers. We're left with a terrible online experience. I played the first Modern Warfare (MW) on the PS3 which had peer to peer online play and it was disastrous. Expect drop outs and poor performance. The host of the game will always have the advantage because they have the better latency.<br /><br />3. No mods. This is surprising because so many other popular games were developed from mods including -- Counterstrike, Team-fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead. The only reason I can think of why IW/Activision would want to do such a thing would be to charge for content later on. I remember paying for 3 maps for the first MW -- and to tell you the truth, it really wasn't worth it.<br /><br />4. Steam required. When you install the game you are required to install the Steam platform and link it to an e-mail address, and your Steam username. This makes reselling the game next to impossible.<br /><br />5. Feels and plays more like a Modern Warfare 1.5 then a Modern Warfare 2.0; the graphics are alright for todays standard, but I was expecting a lot more from IW for a two year development cycle.<br /><br />6. Short single player. Since they've gimped the multiplayer aspect, and the single player can roughly be finished in 6-7 hours, I suggest you rent this on the console if you have one.<br /><br />7. Multiplayer only allows 9 vs 9 (18 player) matches. MW1 allows up to 64 -- does more mean more enjoyable? No, not necessarily, but at least there is choice and server admins were able to set it to their liking.<br /><br />Infinity Ward have really let their fans down. The multi-player made the original spectacular; with the removal of dedicated servers, competitive and fair play is dead.<br /><br />Business schools should take note because this would make a wonderful case study on how a company has ruined one of the most anticipated  franchise in such a short amount of time. MW2 was literally a license to print money for Activison/IW. With such a terrible management decision, reinstating dedicated servers will be the only hope to redeem themselves in the eyes of their consumers -- however I think this fiasco will not be easily forgotten.<br /><br />*** Update 11/18/09<br /><br />Theres hope yet! Hackers have released a patch so you can start/join a dedicated server; its disgusting that this has to come from the underground scene and not Activision/IW. It seems that the hacked copies \"freely\" available over the Internet is now the superior version.<br /><br />Hackers have also found hidden modes via the console -- Global Thermonuclear War, One Flag CTF and VIP mode -- future downloadable content already in the game? How low you've fallen Activision/IW.<br /><br />*** Update 04/16/10<br /><br />I've given up on this game and probably this series for good -- The 'impenetrable' IWNet is plagued with hacks and cheats.  I suggest you all save your money and get Battlefield Bad Company 2 instead;  I've been enjoying the experience so far, its a game that involves more strategy and not your standard Modern Warfare, run and gun. Even the NY Times agrees that Bad Company 2 is a better game than Modern Warfare 2. [...]\n"

    "# The Silent Hill series of video games is one of the best of its genre. With the exception of SH 3, which has more of a blockbustery feel to it, the original game and its sequel, Silent Hill 2, have done more to further the genre of Survival Horror than any other series of games, making Capcom's Resident Evil/Biohazard series look slow and tired.<br />We start off with James Sunderland, a shell of a man since his wife Mary's death, three years before, lost in thought in a bathroom on the outskirts of town. He's come back to SIlent Hill, a resort town full of happy memories for himself and his wife, because he has received a letter from her, saying she will meet him in their 'special place'. And from there, you're pretty much left to piece the story together yourself, thanks to ingenious plot twists and the best characterisation since Final Fantasy 7.<br />The graphics are wonderful. Fuzzy, murky streets and rooms harbour beautifully-rendered, totally ambiguous creatures that scare us becuase of what we cannot see. The superhuman, exaggerated animation of the mannequins and nurses add to the unnatural atmosphere pervading the game. The cut-scene renders are actually beautiful, with Maria and James' exchange in the underground Toluca Prison levels being one of the most riveting pieces of FMV ever. The sound, too, adds greatly to the experience, with grunts, bangs and screams punctuating the sometimes-deafening silence. Because of the game mechanics, what you hear is oftentimes more important than what you see (or believe you see) and it's this, coupled with the storyline and characters, that characterises the unique psychological tension found in this game.<br />The game mechanics are simple to come to terms with and prove themselves after fifteen minutes or so of play time: you don't notice them anymore.<br />A word on what makes SH 2 such a wonderful experience - Characters like Laura, an enigmatic child who claims to know Mary, Eddie Dombrowski, an unhinged giant of a man whose attitude towards cold-blooded murder gives a realistic slant to the psychological horror, and Maria, the sensual and schizophrenic doppelganger of James' dead wife, are so well-realised that we see new characteristics in them each time the game is played. The character of Angela is a particular mystery, and a testament to the strength of emotion that a videogame can create. On paper, the main villian, Pyramid Head, is nothing special (a giant man with a steel pyramid for a head... literally!) but it's the way he moves and the noises he makes that propel him into the history books as one of the scariest villians anywhere, alongside Biohazard's Hunters and The Exorcist's Pazuzu, in terms of the amount of fear he generates. This is the genius of the game, Konami's developers taking painstaking time and effort with the people that populate the terrifying world of Silent Hill, thereby giving us an unforgettable and compelling cast of characters.<br />The replay value is very high, with five different endings to discover, and new things to see and hear each time, every trip you make to Silent Hill 2 leaves you with something new from this bizarre and macabre universe.<br />A word for fans of action-based violence: you'll be disappointed. SH 2 is a story-based, character-driven game, and if it's violence and gore you need, then this won't do. It's a different kind of scary than Resident Evil, Clock Tower etc. For anyone interested in seeing just how far a game can push the concept of psychological horror, or for anyone who loves to get lost in a storyline, this is one of the best examples you can own.<br />Put simply, Silent Hill 2 is an Opus, a magnificent monster of a game that should held up as a standard-bearer by more than just the videogames industry. It's deep, it's complex, it's engaging, and above all, it's excellent. Thoroughly and unequivocally recommended.\"\"\"\n",
